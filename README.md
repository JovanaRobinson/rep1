# Rep1
 I have recreated the Simon Game for my Python/FadeCandy project.
 
 The Simon game is the game of lights in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order.
 I've displayed my colour sequences and other animations using Fadecandy and used Tkinter as my GUI.
 *commits from exercises done in class also available*
 
 Version 1:
 Designed the Red,Blue,Green and Yellow colour blocks in a separate file. 
 Had basic ideas for the game. 
 Did not combine colour blocks into main file yet, just used code to imitate the sequence for the moment.
 
 Version 2:
 Able to execute the colour blocks as a proper sequence.
 Looped back the code to the beginning, this is for when you choose to run the game again.
 Tested out a 5 second timer for user input with try and except functions, did not work.
 Initial Tkinter UI file created.
 
 Version3: [Final Version]
 3 set coloured sequences, increasing time and colour block in next sequence for some difficulty
 New and easier Tkinter UI code implemented. Pulled request from branch.
 A moving 'Hello' animation was created.
 'Right','Wrong' and 'TimeisUp' functions and animations created as different responses to the sequences.
 Added Thread to sure python code ran simutaneously with Tkinter.
 Final animation created that displays a diagonal sequence with alternating strips of leds.
